## Introduction

LSU factorization is a variant of LU decomposition, tailored for specific matrix structures. It provides a way to express a matrix as a product of lower and upper triangular matrices. This decomposition is crucial for solving systems of linear equations, inverting matrices, and computing determinants. 

Our implementation leverages PyTorch, a powerful library for tensor computations, making it easy to integrate LSU factorization into deep learning workflows. The repository aims to provide a straightforward and efficient solution for those needing LSU factorization in their projects.

## Installation

To use this repository, ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed on your system. You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnaanz/lsu.git
```

### Install Requirements

Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

```bash
cd lsu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can use the LSU factorization functions in your Python scripts. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
import torch
from lsu import lsu_factorization

# Create a random matrix
matrix = torch.rand(4, 4)

# Perform LSU factorization
L, S, U = lsu_factorization(matrix)

print("Lower Triangular Matrix L:")
print(L)
print("Diagonal Matrix S:")
print(S)
print("Upper Triangular Matrix U:")
print(U)
```

### Function Overview

- **lsu_factorization(matrix)**: This function takes a matrix as input and returns the lower triangular matrix \( L \), the diagonal matrix \( S \), and the upper triangular matrix \( U \).

## Features

- **Efficient Computation**: The implementation is optimized for performance using PyTorch's tensor operations.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate LSU factorization into existing PyTorch workflows.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.
- **Support for Different Matrix Sizes**: The implementation can handle various matrix sizes and types.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the LSU factorization implementation:

### Example 1: Basic LSU Factorization

```python
import torch
from lsu import lsu_factorization

matrix = torch.tensor([[4.0, 3.0], [6.0, 3.0]])
L, S, U = lsu_factorization(matrix)

print("Matrix:")
print(matrix)
print("L:")
print(L)
print("S:")
print(S)
print("U:")
print(U)
```

### Example 2: Solving Linear Equations

You can use the factorized matrices to solve linear equations efficiently. Here's how:

```python
import torch
from lsu import lsu_factorization

matrix = torch.tensor([[4.0, 3.0], [6.0, 3.0]])
b = torch.tensor([10.0, 12.0])
L, S, U = lsu_factorization(matrix)

# Forward substitution to solve L * y = b
y = torch.linalg.solve(L, b)

# Back substitution to solve U * x = y
x = torch.linalg.solve(U, y)

print("Solution x:")
print(x)
```
